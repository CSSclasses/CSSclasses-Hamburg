# CSSclasses Hamburg 

## What's in here?

We want the CSSclasses Hamburg events as open and transparent as possible. That's why most of the organization is taking place in public. In this repository, we are going to plan the events, collect and discuss ideas, search for new venues, speakers, and maybe sponsors.

## Code of Conduct
While with us, you must comply to our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/CSSclasses/CSSclasses-Hamburg/blob/master/Code-of-Conduct.md).

## Organisation

Most of the organisation which envolves different tasks takes place at our [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/FhqEFeXa/cssclasses-hamburg). Feel free to have a look!
