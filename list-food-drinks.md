## Pizza and salad

* `1 large Joey's Pizza per 2.3 persons => 45 attendees/2.3 = 19,565217391 => 20 pizzas`
* salad: Don't use the same formula as for pizza - order one salad per person

## Drinks

* 2 Liter per person, half lemonade, half water:
* for 60 expected attendees: 60 * 2 = 120L => 60L water (half sparkling half still) + 60L lemonade (more coke than other flavours)
* at the first CSSclasses-HH event 45 attendees drank ~60L so there were some leftovers (warm weather)
* buy on commission so we pay only for what is used

## Snacks

Plan for a short trip to the supermarket to provide some snacks in the afternoon:

* Fruit like apples + bananas
* Cookies
* Salt Sticks
